This document tracks potential improvements and refactoring opportunities for the PDF Viewer POC.

## Future Improvements

### 1. Docker Configuration

**Current State:**
- Makefile has docker commands but no Docker files exist (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile)
- `make docker-up` command available but requires docker-compose.yml

**Proposed Solution:**
- Create `Dockerfile` for backend and frontend
- Create `docker-compose.yml` for full stack

**Priority:** Medium - Nice to have for easier deployment and development environment consistency

---

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline

**Current State:**
- No GitHub Actions workflows directory (.github/workflows/)
- Manual testing required before deployment
- Quality checks run via Makefile only

**Proposed Solution:**
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on PRs
- Automated security scanning (CodeQL, dependency scanning)
- Deploy previews for PRs
- Automated documentation updates

**Priority:** Medium - Valuable for team collaboration and code quality

## Completed Improvements

### Recent (October 2025)
- ✅ **Removed libmagic dependency** - Replaced with lightweight PDF header validation
  - Eliminates system dependency (no more `brew install libmagic` needed)
  - Faster validation using simple header check
  - Simplified cross-platform installation
  - Reduced dependencies and installation complexity
- ✅ **Code refactoring** - Removed 507 lines of overly complicated code (PR #31)
  - Simplified Pydantic models, removed unnecessary computed fields
  - Consolidated duplicate logging logic
  - Removed complex custom serializers
- ✅ **Performance optimizations** - Major improvements across frontend and backend
  - PDF thumbnail caching and lazy loading (70-99% improvement)
  - Search result caching (99% improvement on repeated searches)
  - Chunked file uploads (98% memory reduction)
  - Canvas rendering optimizations
  - HTTP caching headers for static resources
  - Consolidated React useEffect hooks to reduce re-renders
  - Optimized connection pooling for external HTTP requests

### Previous Work
- ✅ Comprehensive test infrastructure (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ Type safety improvements (Python 3.11+ syntax, TypeScript strict mode)
- ✅ Security enhancements and git cleanup
- ✅ Documentation consolidation
- ✅ Ground truth comparison UI for extracted fields
